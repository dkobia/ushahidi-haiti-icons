This is a set of icons based on the work of Gerd Arntz: http://www.gerdarntz.org/home

Prepared by Chris Blow and Caleb Bell.

They are freely reusable in noncommercial contexts. For an overview see this flattened image showing the icons on various background with adjustments.

This is part of a larger ongoing project for pictographic humanitarian map design; others may be released at some point. If you have questions or ideas about the direction of the icons please contact cgblow@gmail.com.

Roadmap: We are currently looking into ways to automate the customization of the icons, to create a larger set for use in humanitarian mapping contexts. Let me know if you would like to collaborate!
